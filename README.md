# Test program for UCSD CSE131 Project 1

### Usage

    Usage: test.sh [-cdh] dir
        -d	use RCdbg instead of RC
        -h	print this message
        dir	give the directory to correct


Simply provide the directory containing your code as a program argument.

You can also decide to use `RCdbg` instead of `RC` or use a different Makefile rule.

### Example

While in the test directory:

    git clone https://github.com/Hyrrmadr/CSE131Project1Tests.git
    cd CSE131Project1Tests
    ./test.sh ~/CSE131/project1

While in the code directory:

    git clone https://github.com/Hyrrmadr/CSE131Project1Tests.git ~
    ~/CSE131Project1Tests/test.sh .

### Output

The program output the name of the test followed by the encountered errors or `GOOD` in case of success.

The final line contains the number of good results compared to the total number of tests.

Here are the different errors:

 - **BAD**: the compilation of the source is different from the expected output

Each of these errors will display the output generated by your compiler (with a `diff`), your Makefile (without a `diff`) or your compiled assembly (with a `diff`).
